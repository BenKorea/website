The definition of small cell lung cancer is divided into two stages as shown in @tbl-stages.

<div>

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| **Limited Stage** | Stage I-III (T any, N any, M0) that can be safely treated with definitive radiation doses. Excludes T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too extensive or tumor/nodal volume too large to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan. |
| **Extensive Stage** | Stage IV (T any, N any, M1a/b/c), or T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too extensive or tumor/nodal volume too large to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan. |
