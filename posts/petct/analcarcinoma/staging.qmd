| **T4b**     | Not applicable                                                                                     | Tumor invading adjacent structures (vagina, urethra, bladder, etc.)                               |

*Note*: The main difference between the AJCC 8th and 9th Editions is the subdivision of T4 into T4a and T4b in the 9th Edition, which provides a more detailed categorization for advanced local disease.

## M stage

# Anal Cancer M Stage Comparison: AJCC 8th vs. 9th Edition

| **M Stage** | **AJCC 8th Edition**         | **AJCC 9th Edition**         |
|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **M0**      | No distant metastasis        | No distant metastasis        |
| **M1**      | Distant metastasis present   | Distant metastasis present   |
| **M1a**     | *Not applicable*             | Metastasis to non-regional lymph nodes or organs (e.g., liver, lung) |
| **M1b**     | *Not applicable*             | Metastasis to other distant sites (e.g., bone, brain) |

> **Note:**  
> - The AJCC 9th edition introduces subcategories (M1a, M1b) to provide more detailed classification of distant metastases.  
> - Ensure you consult the official AJCC manual for clinical use and precise staging details.
